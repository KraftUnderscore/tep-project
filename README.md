# tep-project

The goal of this university project was to optimize profits for given certain nodes in the supply chain (such as suppliers, factories, warehouses, shops). The problem was simplified to manage only one type of resource by all of the nodes. It contains a few generators to create problems (find parameters for all nodes) that match all requirements. It's also prepared for solution generation. Sadly, because our course came to an early end there's only random solutions generator.
